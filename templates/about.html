            <p>
              <strong>Harvest Horizon</strong> is an Egyptian company founded in <strong>2025</strong>, dedicated to connecting the rich agricultural heritage of Egypt with markets around the world. We specialize in sourcing fresh fruits and vegetables from <strong>small-scale farmers</strong> across the country, ensuring fair trade practices and promoting sustainable agriculture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our core focus is on <strong>exporting</strong>—managing the process with precision and care to guarantee that every shipment arrives <strong>fresh, compliant, and on-spec</strong> at the recipient’s port. From field to freight, we prioritize quality control, proper handling, and timely logistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Harvest Horizon, we bridge the gap between Egypt’s fertile land and global demand, delivering produce that reflects our commitment to excellence, transparency, and reliability.
